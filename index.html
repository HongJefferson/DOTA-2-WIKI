		Dota 2 is a free-to-play multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) video game developed and published by Valve Corporation.<br>
	The game is the stand-alone sequel to Defense of the Ancients (DotA),<br>
	which was a community-created mod for Blizzard Entertainment's Warcraft III: Reign of Chaos and its expansion pack, The Frozen Throne. <br>
	Dota 2 is played in matches between two teams that consist of five players, with both teams occupying their own separate base on the map.<br>
	Each of the ten players independently control a powerful character, known as a "hero", that each feature unique abilities and different styles of play. <br>
	During a match, a player and their team collects experience points and items for their heroes in order to fight through the opposing team's heroes and other defenses.<br>
	A team wins by being the first to destroy a large structure located in the opposing team's base, called the "Ancient".<br>
	This game has three classes namely the strength class,agility class, and the intelligence class<br>
	And this website will give you the information about the top 5 Carry in each class.<br></h1>

		The International, often abbreviated as TI, is an annual tournament organized by Valve.<br>
		In 2015 Valve increased their number of hosted events, founding the Dota Major Championships which incorporates The International into its structure.<br>
	The International remains the biggest and most prestigious event on the Major Championship circuit.<br>
	The first International was held in Cologne, Germany, during the trade show Gamescom, in order to unveil Dota 2 to worldwide audiences. <br>
	It drew attention due to its staggering $1.6 million USD prize pool (with $1 million for the champion). 16 teams were invited to play for the title.<br>
	In 2012 The International moved to Seattle, Washington. The prize pool remained at $1.6 million USD.<br>
	Only 14 teams were invited; two additional slots were awarded to the winners of regional qualifiers.<br>
	Since 2013, the Dota 2 community has been able to contribute to the prize pool. The total prize of The International 2013 grew to $2.8 million USD. <br>
	In 2014, the prize pool surpassed $10 million. In 2016, it eclipsed $20 million, making The International the biggest esports tournament in terms of prize pool.<br></h1>
