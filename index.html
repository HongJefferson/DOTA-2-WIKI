			Dota 2 is a free-to-play multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) video game developed and published by Valve Corporation.<br>
			The game is the stand-alone sequel to Defense of the Ancients (DotA), which was a community-created mod for<br>
			Blizzard Entertainment's Warcraft III: Reign of Chaos and its expansion pack, The Frozen Throne. Dota 2 is played in matches<br>
			between two teams that consist of five players, with both teams occupying their own separate base on the map. Each of the ten<br>
			players independently control a powerful character, known as a "hero", that each feature unique abilities and different styles<br>
			of play. During a match, a player and their team collects experience points and items for their heroes in order to fight through<br>
			the opposing team's heroes and other defenses. A team wins by being the first to destroy a large structure located in the opposing<br>
			team's base, called the "Ancient".<br>
			Development of Dota 2 began in 2009 when IceFrog, the pseudonymous lead designer of the original Defense of the Ancients mod,<br>
			was hired by Valve to create a modern sequel. Dota 2 was officially released on Steam in July 2013 for Microsoft Windows,<br>
			OS X, and Linux-based personal computers, following a Windows-only open beta phase that began two years prior. Despite some <br>
			criticism going towards its steep learning curve and complexity, the game was praised for its rewarding gameplay, production<br>
			quality, and faithfulness to its predecessor. The game initially used the original Source game engine until it was ported over<br>
			to Source 2 in 2015, making it the first game to use it. Since its release, Dota 2 has been the most played game on Steam, <br>
			with peaks of over a million concurrent players. The popularity of the game has led to official merchandise being produced for <br>
			it, including apparel, accessories, and toys, as well as promotional tie-ins to other games and media. The game also allows for<br>
			the community to create custom game modes, maps, and cosmetics for the heroes, which are uploaded to the Steam Workshop.<br>
			Dota 2 has a widespread and active competitive scene, with teams from across the world playing professionally in various leagues<br>
			and tournaments. Premium Dota 2 tournaments often have prize pools totaling millions of US dollars, the highest of any eSport.<br>
			The largest of them is known as The International, which is produced by Valve and held annually at the KeyArena in Seattle. <br>
			Valve also sponsors smaller, but more frequently held tournaments known as the Majors, which lead up to the International every<br>
			year. For larger tournaments, media coverage is done by a selection of on-site staff who provide commentary and analysis for <br>
			the ongoing matches, similar to traditional sporting events. Broadcasts of professional Dota 2 matches are streamed live over <br>
			the internet, and sometimes simulcast on television networks, with peak viewership numbers in the millions.<br></h1>
